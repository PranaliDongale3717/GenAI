/*PROBLEM STATEMENT: A manufacturer claims that the mean lifetime of a certain type of
battery is at least 1000 hours. A consumer agency tests a random sample of 36 batteries and finds the sample mean is 980 hours with a population standard deviation of 60 hours. Perform
following tasks-
● State the null and alternative hypotheses.
● Perform a hypothesis test at the 5% significance level.
● Find the critical value and the test statistic.
● Conclude whether the claim can be accepted or rejected.*/
