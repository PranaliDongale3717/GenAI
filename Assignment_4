/*A school has selected a group of 20 students for a debate competition. 
The task is to determine the number of different teams of 3 students that can be formed from this group. 
This involves calculating combinations, where the order of selection does not matter.*/

CODE:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){

	int n, r;
	
  //Accept details of Students selected for competition
	cout<<"Enter no. of students selected for debate competition:";
	cin>>n;
	
	//Accept details of Students whose group can be made
	cout<<"Enter no. of students whose group can be made:";
	cin>>r;
	
	//First calculation for permutation 
	int ways=1;
	for(int i=0;i<r;i++){
		ways*=(n-i);
	}
	
	//Calculation for factorial of r
	int factorial=1;
	for(int i=1;i<=r;i++){
		factorial *=i;
	}
	
	


          //Calculation for combinations for group formation
	int combination = ways/factorial;
	cout<<"\nThe number of different teams of " << r << " students that can be   
                       formed:"<<combination;
