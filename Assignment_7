TITLE:Measures of Dispersion
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
A teacher wants to compare the consistency of study hours between two different groups of students. 
To achieve this, the teacher needs to analyze the range, variance, and standard deviation of study hours data for both groups. 
This analysis will help in understanding how dispersed the data is around the average, offering insight into study behavior differences between the groups.

PROGRAM:
import statistics
def get_data(group):
    data = list(map(float, input(f"Enter study hours for {group} (space separated): ").split()))
    print(f"Data entered for {group}: {data}")  
    return data

def analyze(data, group):
    mean = statistics.mean(data)
    variance = statistics.pvariance(data)      # population variance
    std_dev = statistics.pstdev(data)           # population std deviation
    data_range = max(data) - min(data)
    
    print(f"\n{group} Study Hours Analysis:")
    print(f"Mean (Average): {mean:.2f}")
    print(f"Range (Max - Min): {data_range:.2f}")
    print(f"Population Variance: {variance:.2f}")
    print(f"Population Standard Deviation: {std_dev:.2f}")
    
    return mean, variance, std_dev, data_range

g1 = get_data("Group 1")
analyze(g1, "Group 1")

g2 = get_data("Group 2")
analyze(g2, "Group 2")
